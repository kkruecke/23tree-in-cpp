Insertion
---------

Insertion begins at the root node where the search for the key terminated. If the leaf is a 2-node, we simply insert the new key and value into the leaf,
and we are done. If it is a 3-node, we create a 4-node on the stack from the 3-node leaf and the new key. The 4-node ctor automatically sorts
all three keys. We then "split" the 4-node into two 2-nodes: the smaller node holding the keys_values[0], the larger holding kyes_values[2].


Only the large 2-node, however, is allocated from the heap. For the other, smaller 2-node we simply downsize the leaf node from a 3-node to a 2-node.
This is done by the method ...

The 4-node constructor creates the hap-allocated 2-node.
