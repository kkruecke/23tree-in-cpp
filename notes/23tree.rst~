Insertion
---------

Insertion begins at the leaf node where the search for the new key terminated. 

<example>


If the leaf is a 2-node, we simply insert the new key and its associated value into the leaf, and we are done. If the leaf node is a 3-node, we create
a 4-node on the stack using a constructor that take the 3-node leaf and the new key as input. The 4-node ctor automatically sorts
all three keys.

We then "split" the 4-node into two 2-nodes: the smaller node holding the keys_values[0], the larger holding kyes_values[2]. This is done in 
split(...).

The code to downsize the leaf node is the convertTo2Node

<show convertTo2Node here>

Only the large 2-node, however, is allocated from the heap. The other, smaller 2-node is simply the leaf node downsized from a 3-node to a 2-node.

Next split() considers three cases...If the parent is a 2-node, we convert it to a 3-node. This rebalances the tree

<show the convertTo3Node() method here>

If the parent is an internal 3-node (as will be the case as long a the parent is not the root), we recurse by calling split() again, passing...

The middle value from the 4-node is next pushed up to the parent node. If it is a 3-node
