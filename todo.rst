Convert from recursive Node constructor and assignment operator to using copy_subtree, as done in the binary search tree code. 
Analyze Node recursive algorithm vs copy_tree. See `Time Complexity of Resursive Algorithms: The Master Theorem <https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/time-complexity-recursive-functions/>`_
