## External In-Order, STL-like Iterator has been implemented for forward iteration. We need to add the capability to get the predecessor to enable bidirectional iteration

In the stl, once the end of a map is reached using the map's bidirectoinal iterator, you can still call the `operator--()` of the iterator to go to the last node in
the tree. I am not sure how this is implemented, but it does one to go back from the one-past the last key/value.

Question: According to "The C++ Programming Language, 4th Edition" begin() returns the first element in the container. So what should or does 
operator--() return when it is called immediately after begin()?  

Answer: It should not do anything. 

Better, simply define a `postion_state`s enough `enum { beg, middle, end}` of **three mutually exclusive states**--beginning, niddle, end--is clearer
and better.

### Red Black code

This is the red black tree increment method fo stdlibc++ below that was used to guide the findLeafNodeSuccessor() code:

    // stdlibc++ source code for red black tree increment
    static _Rb_tree_node_base*
      local_Rb_tree_increment(_Rb_tree_node_base* __x) throw ()
      {
        // If there is a right subtree, get its left most node.
        if (__x->_M_right != 0) 
          {
            __x = __x->_M_right;
            while (__x->_M_left != 0)
              __x = __x->_M_left;
          }
        else
          {
           // An illustration what the loop below is doing (in a balanced red black tree)
           // It ascend x's parent nodes as long as they are right children. It stops when the parent is not 
           /*
                   57 
                   / \
                 55
                   \
                    40  
                   /  \
                 35   45
                / \   / \
               30 38 43  50 

              At this point we have a leaf node most likely. It could be a node that is a left child of its parent already, or it could be
              a right child, and its parent could likewise be a right child. In this case, we ascend until the node is no longer a right child.

            _Rb_tree_node_base* __y = __x->_M_parent; // else retrieve its parent 
           
            while (__x == __y->_M_right) // Ascend as long as the parent node is always a right child.
              {
                __x = __y;
                __y = __y->_M_parent;
              }
            if (__x->_M_right != __y) // I am not sure what this does?
                __x = __y;
          }
        return __x;
      }
    
      _Rb_tree_node_base*
      _Rb_tree_increment(_Rb_tree_node_base* __x) throw ()
      {
        return local_Rb_tree_increment(__x);
      }
    
      const _Rb_tree_node_base*
      _Rb_tree_increment(const _Rb_tree_node_base* __x) throw ()
      {
        return local_Rb_tree_increment(const_cast<_Rb_tree_node_base*>(__x));
      }
