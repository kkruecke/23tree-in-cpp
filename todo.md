# Things to work on

## Test new code

Test tree23 copy constructor and assignment operator have been implemented using `CloneTree()` and `DestroyTree()`. They have not been tested.

## Implement an External In-Order, STL-like Iterator

### Implementation Links and Discusssion

1. [odu] - Traversing Trees with Iterator, an STL-compatible iterator Q&A teaching discussion
2. [geeksforgeeks] - Conceptual Discussion with C code implementation using a stack.
3. [stackoverflow] - Stackoverflow Discussion with a link to SGI STL implmentation 
4. [FSU] - FSU lecture that discusses external bidirectional tree iterator in C++
5. [cmu] - See Non-Recursive Traversals section that discuss forward iteration in Java using a stack
6. [csohio] - Discusses trees and has an implementation in Java

New prospective external iterator code has been started in tree23.h. Prior tree23 code that successfully compiles and runs is in
tree23.h.orig.

TODO: 

1. See the "TODO" in findLeafNodeSuccessor(). 
2. Also check code that does end() and its associated iterators.
3. iterator\_base stores either a "const tree23" or just "tree23, but iterator alters the tree, so it should not be const, well for const\_iterator it should be.

This is the red black tree increment method fo stdlibc++ below that was used to guide the findLeafNodeSuccessor() code:

    // stdlibc++ source code for red black tree increment
    static _Rb_tree_node_base*
      local_Rb_tree_increment(_Rb_tree_node_base* __x) throw ()
      {
        // If there is a right subtree, get its left most node.
        if (__x->_M_right != 0) 
          {
            __x = __x->_M_right;
            while (__x->_M_left != 0)
              __x = __x->_M_left;
          }
        else
          {
            _Rb_tree_node_base* __y = __x->_M_parent; // else retrieve its parent 

           // TODO: Draw a picture of what this loop is doing (in a balanced red black tree)
           // Ascend x's parent nodes as long as they are right children.
           /*
                55
                  \
                  40  
                  /  \
                 35    45
                / \    / \
               30 38  43  50 

            */

            while (__x == __y->_M_right) // Ascend as long as the parent node is always a right child.
              {
                __x = __y;
                __y = __y->_M_parent;
              }
            if (__x->_M_right != __y) // What does this do? Draw it out on paper.
              __x = __y;
          }
        return __x;
      }
    
      _Rb_tree_node_base*
      _Rb_tree_increment(_Rb_tree_node_base* __x) throw ()
      {
        return local_Rb_tree_increment(__x);
      }
    
      const _Rb_tree_node_base*
      _Rb_tree_increment(const _Rb_tree_node_base* __x) throw ()
      {
        return local_Rb_tree_increment(const_cast<_Rb_tree_node_base*>(__x));
      }
