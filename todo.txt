The code could be changed to work more like the 234 code. Since ReassignChildren() is always called after Redistribute(), it doesn't make sense to have
two separate routines. Redistribute() seems to do either a left or right rotation. So I could instead create leftRotate() and rightRotate(). I could also add 
similar helper methods to the 2 3 4 code: insertChild(), connectChild() and disconnectChild(). 

Of course, the 2 3 rotation logic may not be identical to the 2 3 4 code, as the 2 3 code also uses a 4 node in some cases. So any change would first require 
understanding again what the 2 3 insertion code actually does.
  
The code could also be changed to use

1. unique_ptr<Node23>
2. array<K, 2> for the keys
3. array<Node23*, 3> or array<unique_ptr<Mode23>, 3> for the keys


The code has a weird implementation in that Node23, if a 2-node, saves the right child in children[2] and not children[1].
