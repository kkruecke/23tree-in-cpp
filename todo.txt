Documentation
-------------

https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html lets you demo insert
and delete.


remove()
========

Do the documentation for insertion, after doing the documentation for the
nested classes. Use the working examples from the Walls and Mirrors ppt. Use
its pseudo code with my modifications. Use its diagrams that illustrate the
pseudo code. Also provide 4-node diagram of an insertion use case that
illustrates all insertion use cases--recursive splits of 3-nodes, splitting
the root, etc. For slides use eith dia or google drawing app or draw.io

TODO
----

Double check this:

When 

   node2Delete.reset();

is called in fixTree(), it invokes the delete operator on the underlying raw
Node23 pointer, which in term invokes the destructors for the members of
Node23, which are 

       std::array<KeyValue, 2> keys_values;

This in turn invokes the destructor for each KeyValue within the std::array.
