There seems to be a bug in split(). When split recurses, it passes

     // parent now has three items, so we can't insert the middle item. We recurse to split it.
     // TODO: is new_value correct???? Shouldn't the third parameter be node4.keys_values[1].value!!!!!
     split(parent, node4.keys_values[1].key, new_value, child_indecies, std::move(larger_2node)); 

However, the third parameter seems wrong, as pointed out in the TODO comment
above. Instead, the line should be 

     split(parent, node4.keys_values[1].key, node4.keys_values[1].value, child_indecies, std::move(larger_2node));
