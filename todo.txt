The code could be simplified by merging Redistribute() and ReassignChildren() into one routine called perhaps Rotate(). This routine could perhaps be modeled after
part of the insersion logic of the 2 3 4 code, which uses helper methods like insertChild() connectChild() and disconnectChild().

The code could also be changed to use

1. unique_ptr<Node23>
2. array<K, 2> for the keys
3. array<Node23*, 3> or array<unique_ptr<Mode23>, 3> for the keys
