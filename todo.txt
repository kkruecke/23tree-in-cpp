Documentation
-------------

https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html lets you demo insert
and delete.


remove()
========

Do the documentation for insertion, after doing the documentation for the nested classes. Use a working
example and print out steps during insertion--or just use slides made using:

1. yEd
2. Gliffy
3. Inkscape
4. libreoffice draw
5. vym 
6. lucidchart
 
Question
--------

Does the value objects dtor need to be manually invoked:

   object_instance.~ValueClassName();when a key is removed.
