23tree-in-cpp
=============

2 3 tree implemented in C++. See [Implementing a 2 3 Tree in C++](http://cplusplus.kurttest.com/notes/tree23.html ). The code was compiled using g++
compiler with the option **-std=c++14** . 

Everything seems to work, including the iterator classes, with the exeception that rbegin() seems to return an iterator that does not work properly
